Abstract:

On-board NASAâ€™s Terra and Aqua polar-orbiting satellites, the
Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors provide daily
Thermal Anomaly and Fire detection product at a 1km resolution. Aside the scientific
questions related to climate science, the MODIS Fire products have recently
been used to monitor violence in war-torn Darfur (Sudan) in 2003 (Bromley, 2010).
Artillery shelling, air strikes, violence and looting of populated areas often triggers
fires and leave burned scars which are readily detectable in satellite data. Therefore
MODIS Fire products could be crucial to monitor violence on civilian population
and document war crimes. In this work, we use MODIS Thermal Anomaly
and Fire product to try and document shelling activities in two active areas of the
front line in eastern Ukraine.
